# Quiz-application-with-timer
Quiz Questions and Options:
We’ll start by defining a set of quiz questions along with their multiple-choice options and correct answers. You can store this information in a data structure (e.g., an array or a list).
Timer Implementation:
We’ll use Java’s Timer class to create a countdown timer for each question.
When a question is displayed, start the timer.
If the user submits an answer before the timer expires, stop the timer.
If the timer reaches zero, automatically move to the next question.
Question Display:
Present one question at a time to the user.
Display the question text and its multiple-choice options.
Allow the user to select an option.
Answer Submission:
After the user selects an option, check if it matches the correct answer.
If correct, update the user’s score.
Move to the next question.
Score Calculation:
Keep track of the user’s score throughout the quiz.
Increment the score for each correct answer.
Display the final score at the end of the quiz.
Result Screen:
After all questions are answered, display the final score.
Provide a summary of correct and incorrect answers.
